            <p class="font-medium text-lg">In JavaScript, variable scope determines where a variable can be accessed. Three
                keywords define scope: var, let, and const.
                <br>
                <span class="mb-5 line-clamp-1">
                    1. Var:

                    Function Scope: Limited to the function where declared. If outside any function, it becomes global.
                    Hoisting: Variables are hoisted to the top of their scope, potentially causing unexpected
                    behavior.<br>
                </span>

                <span class="mb-5 line-clamp-1">
                    2. Let:

                    Block Scope: Confined to the block where declared, like within loops or conditionals.
                    No Hoisting: Variables must be declared before use, enhancing predictability.<br>
                </span>
                <span>
                    3. Const:

                    Block Scope: Block-level scope, similar to let.
                    Constants: Values cannot be reassigned after declaration, except for properties or elements in
                    objects and arrays declared with const.<br>

            <p class="font-medium text-lg">REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a standardized way for software applications to communicate over the internet. It uses HTTP requests to perform operations on data resources, typically in JSON or XML format. REST APIs are designed around a set of principles, including statelessness, client-server architecture, and a uniform and predictable URL structure. They are widely used for building web services, allowing different systems to interact and exchange data efficiently</p>
